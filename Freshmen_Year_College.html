<p>“The Color of Emotion” 
Written by Una Roberts  
November 21, 2024 
In a brick apartment building, there is a window into a girl's room. The room is 
cozy, the right wall partially covered with posters and the back wall with lights. There is a 
bed, a desk and a small side table with a lamp on it. A girl, colored all in gray, 
representing her frustration and restlessness, sits at the desk typing on her computer 
and a boy, colored all in yellow for happiness and peacefulness, sits on the bed reading.  
The girl types at her computer for a few seconds, becoming more and more visibly 
frustrated- her expression gets more upset, and her gray color gets darker. Suddenly she 
becomes so overwhelmingly frustrated that she slams her head down on the table. 
When she lifts her head, she is crying in frustration. She turns to look at her boyfriend, 
then gets up and walks over to him, beside the bed.  
Her boyfriend looks up at her and sees that she is crying. He asks her what is 
wrong and in response she continues to cry. He opens his arms to offer her a hug and 
she accepts, collapsing into the hug. Slowly, she starts to smile, and she starts to turn 
from gray to yellow, showing how one can help comfort their friends or partners. The girl 
returns to her desk with a renewed energy and fully colored in yellow. </p>

<h1>Project for 'Big Chicago' Class</h1>

<p>During my first semester in college, I took a class called "Big Chicago: A City of Neighborhoods". In this class, one of our assignments was to visit a Chicago neighborhood and document and answer a list of questions in some way. I chose to make a print, with an accompanying artist statement.</p>
  
<div class="image-section">

</div>


<p>I wanted to draw a comparison between my neighborhood, Bay View, and Chinatown through my prints of them both. The print of Bay View, called “Everything Happens on Kinnickinnic” is a piece I did in high school, meant to explore my relationship with my neighborhood and why it is important to me. I am calling my new print “Everything Happens on Wentworth” to emphasize the similarities and differences between the two pieces.  For both pieces I took some creative liberty with the reality of the street it is based on- I took the most important places from both neighborhoods and collaged them all into an image that I think captures the essence of the neighborhood I was focusing on. While both pieces share a similar layout, “Everything Happens on Kinnickinnic” features more houses and a church with a cross on top. In “Everything Happens on Wentworth” I incorporated a picture of a church into the print; however, it looked like a regular building without any religious identifiers. I also printed the image of Chinatown on red paper because I thought it held the print better and made everything feel warm, in a way that I think serves the purpose of communicating the overall feeling of the neighborhood.  My own neighborhood does not have a huge cultural background- it is recently gentrified but before that I am pretty sure it was considered one of the ‘less desirable’ neighborhoods. Now, it is mostly full of hippies- lots of young couples without kids and a couple families like mine of older parents and college age kids. It is a nice place, with lots of overpriced coffee shops (three within a block of each other) and shops that sell relatively useless knickknacks. The neighborhood is mainly centered around one street, called Kinnickinnic, with the rest mostly being residential. Chinatown was similar in this way- everything seemed to center mainly around Wentworth. The actual layouts felt similar, however the culture in Chinatown felt clearer and more established, and it felt more like a connected community.  There were a lot of older businesses that appeared to be family run and that had possibly sold the same things for a long time. There were also more “trendy” stores like boba shops and toy stores. It seemed like the neighborhood is meant for families, since there seemed to be a lot there.  </p>
